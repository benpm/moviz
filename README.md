Visualization of your favorite movies :) project for Visualization for Data Science Fall 2022

## Brainstorm
- Main viz: scatterplot of movies with editable axes
- Secondary: line chart with time x axis?
- Story we are telling?

## Proposal
The proposal document should address the following points. Use these points as headers in your document.

- Basic Info. The project title, your names, e-mail addresses, UIDs, a link to the project repository.
- Background and Motivation. Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision.
- Project Objectives. Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.
- Data. From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.
- Data Processing. Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented?
- Visualization Design. How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualization design. Develop three alternative prototype designs for your visualization. Create one final design that incorporates the best of your three designs. Describe your designs and justify your choices of visual encodings. We recommend you use the Five Design Sheet Methodology.
- Must-Have Features. List the features without which you would consider your project to be a failure.
- Optional Features. List the features which you consider to be nice to have, but not critical.
- Project Schedule. Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines.

This proposal is the first part of your process book. As a ballpark number: your proposal should contain about 3-4 pages of text, plus 5-6 pages of sketches.

Based on your proposals we will assign a staff member to your team who will guide you through the rest of the project. You will schedule a project review meeting with a staff member during regular lecture times of the week marked in the schedule. Make sure all of your team members are present at the meeting.

The proposal will be submitted by uploading it to your teamâ€™s GitHub repository.
