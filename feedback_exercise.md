# Design Feedback

- Put selection for axes directly on axis labels
- Make the legend filterable - clicking on the legend would filter movies by the selected oscar status
- Consider hovering on heatmap cell highlights corresponding films in scatterplot
- Force relaxation on scatterplot
- Ratings vs ratings views
- We should get the rotten tomatoes scores
- Coloration for profit > budget and profit > budget + advertising margin
- Add additional detailed comparison between two individual movies when selecting just two
- Scrape movie posters and show them when interacting with individual movies in scatterplot
- Idea: for decades heatmap, use circles of different area showing density, use force relaxation
- Highlight animation on scatterplot on mouseover
