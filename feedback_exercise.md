- put selection for axes directly on axis labels
- make the legend filterable - clicking on the legend would filter movies by the selected oscar status
- consider hovering on heatmap cell highlights corresponding films in scatterplot
- force relaxation on scatterplot
- ratings vs ratings views
- we should get the rotten tomatoes scores
- coloration for profit > budget and profit > budget + advertising margin
- add additional detailed comparison between two individual movies when selecting just two
- scrape movie posters and show them when interacting with individual movies in scatterplot
